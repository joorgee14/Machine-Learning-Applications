# Machine-Learning-Applications
Grade: 9.688

During this course, we have learned about:

Designing a data model for a data analysis task
Selecting and using effectively data analysis methods
Cleaning, adapting and processing text data
Designing and applying Natural Language Processing methods
Designing and applying Recommender Systems
Final project:
The objective of this project was to apply machine learning techniques to a large-scale text mining problem. Our dataset consisted of thousands of text documents, each accompanied by metadata. The project was divided into several core tasks:

Task 1: Text Preprocessing and Vectorization
We implemented a complete NLP pipeline for text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, etc.) and explored multiple vectorization strategies:

Bag of Words (BoW) / TF-IDF

Word2Vec embeddings

Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Task 2.2: Clustering
As our dataset lacked a clear target variable, we performed unsupervised learning using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means).
We evaluated different vectorizations and the impact of dimensionality reduction and feature selection techniques.
Clustering performance was analyzed using internal metrics such as the Silhouette Coefficient and cluster visualizations.

Task 3: Interactive Dashboard
We created an interactive dashboard using Dash (Plotly) that allows users to explore:

Topic distributions per document (LDA)

Clustering results

Other metadata insights
The dashboard supports interactive filtering and dynamic updates across charts.

Task 4: Final Report and Presentation
The final submission included a detailed PDF report, commented code, and a live presentation defending our methodology and results.
